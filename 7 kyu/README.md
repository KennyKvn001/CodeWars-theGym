## Question1: regex validatePin

ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

Examples (Input --> Output)
"1234" --> true
"12345" --> false
"a234" --> false

## Question2: Get the Middle Character

You are going to be given a non-empty string. Your job is to return the middle character(s) of the string.

If the string's length is odd, return the middle character.
If the string's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.
Examples:
"test" --> "es"
"testing" --> "t"
"middle" --> "dd"
"A" --> "A"

## Question3 : String ends with

Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

Examples:

solution('abc', 'bc') // returns true
solution('abc', 'd') // returns false

## Question4 : Vowel Count

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

## Question5: Balanced Number (Special Numbers Series #1 )

A balanced number is a number where the sum of digits to the left of the middle digit(s) and the sum of digits to the right of the middle digit(s) are equal.

If the number has an odd number of digits, then there is only one middle digit. (For example, 92645 has one middle digit, 6.) Otherwise, there are two middle digits. (For example, the middle digits of 1301 are 3 and 0.)

The middle digit(s) should not be considered when determining whether a number is balanced or not, e.g. 413023 is a balanced number because the left sum and right sum are both 5.

The task
Given a number, find if it is balanced, and return the string "Balanced" or "Not Balanced" accordingly. The passed number will always be positive.

Examples
7 ==> return "Balanced"
Explanation:
middle digit(s): 7
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 0
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 0
0 and 0 are equal, so it's balanced.
295591 ==> return "Not Balanced"
Explanation:
middle digit(s): 55
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 11
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 10
11 and 10 are not equal, so it's not balanced.
959 ==> return "Balanced"
Explanation:
middle digit(s): 5
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 9
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 9
9 and 9 are equal, so it's balanced.
27102983 ==> return "Not Balanced"
Explanation:
middle digit(s): 02
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 10
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 20
10 and 20 are not equal, so it's not balanced.
