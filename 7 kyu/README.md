## Question1: regex validatePin

ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

Examples (Input --> Output)
"1234" --> true
"12345" --> false
"a234" --> false

## Question2: Get the Middle Character

You are going to be given a non-empty string. Your job is to return the middle character(s) of the string.

If the string's length is odd, return the middle character.
If the string's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.
Examples:
"test" --> "es"
"testing" --> "t"
"middle" --> "dd"
"A" --> "A"

## Question3 : String ends with

Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

Examples:

solution('abc', 'bc') // returns true
solution('abc', 'd') // returns false

## Question4 : Vowel Count

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

## Question5: Balanced Number (Special Numbers Series #1 )

A balanced number is a number where the sum of digits to the left of the middle digit(s) and the sum of digits to the right of the middle digit(s) are equal.

If the number has an odd number of digits, then there is only one middle digit. (For example, 92645 has one middle digit, 6.) Otherwise, there are two middle digits. (For example, the middle digits of 1301 are 3 and 0.)

The middle digit(s) should not be considered when determining whether a number is balanced or not, e.g. 413023 is a balanced number because the left sum and right sum are both 5.

The task
Given a number, find if it is balanced, and return the string "Balanced" or "Not Balanced" accordingly. The passed number will always be positive.

Examples
7 ==> return "Balanced"
Explanation:
middle digit(s): 7
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 0
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 0
0 and 0 are equal, so it's balanced.
295591 ==> return "Not Balanced"
Explanation:
middle digit(s): 55
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 11
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 10
11 and 10 are not equal, so it's not balanced.
959 ==> return "Balanced"
Explanation:
middle digit(s): 5
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 9
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 9
9 and 9 are equal, so it's balanced.
27102983 ==> return "Not Balanced"
Explanation:
middle digit(s): 02
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 10
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 20
10 and 20 are not equal, so it's not balanced.

## Question6: Strong Number (Special Numbers Series #2)

Strong number is a number with the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to the number itself.

For example, 145 is strong, because 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Task
Given a positive number, find if it is strong or not, and return either "STRONG!!!!" or "Not Strong !!".

Examples
1 is a strong number, because 1! = 1, so return "STRONG!!!!".
123 is not a strong number, because 1! + 2! + 3! = 9 is not equal to 123, so return "Not Strong !!".
145 is a strong number, because 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145, so return "STRONG!!!!".
150 is not a strong number, because 1! + 5! + 0! = 122 is not equal to 150, so return "Not Strong !!".

## Question7 : Cat and Mouse - Easy Version

You will be given a string featuring a cat 'C' and a mouse 'm'. The rest of the string will be made up of '.'. The string will start with the cat, and end with the mouse.

You need to find out if the cat can catch the mouse from its current position. The cat can jump over at most three characters. So:

"C.....m" returns "Escaped!" <-- more than three characters between

"C...m" returns "Caught!" <-- as there are three characters between the two, the cat can jump.

## Question8 : Nice Array

A Nice array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, there is also an element n - 1 or n + 1 in the array.

examples:

[2, 10, 9, 3] is a nice array because

2 = 3 - 1
10 = 9 + 1
3 = 2 + 1
9 = 10 - 1

[4, 2, 3] is a nice array because

4 = 3 + 1
2 = 3 - 1
3 = 2 + 1 (or 3 = 4 - 1)

[4, 2, 1] is a not a nice array because

for n = 4, there is neither n - 1 = 3 nor n + 1 = 5
Write a function named isNice/IsNice that returns true if its array argument is a Nice array, else false. An empty array is not considered nice.

## Question9 : Jaden Casing Strings

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased: "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

## Question10 : Least Larger

Given an array of numbers and an index, return either the index of the smallest number that is larger than the element at the given index, or -1 if there is no such index ( or, where applicable, Nothing or a similarly empty value ).

Notes
Multiple correct answers may be possible. In this case, return any one of them.
The given index will be inside the given array.
The given array will, therefore, never be empty.

Example
leastLarger( [4, 1, 3, 5, 6], 0 ) => 3
leastLarger( [4, 1, 3, 5, 6], 4 ) => -1

## Question11 : Numbers in strings

In this Kata, you will be given a string that has lowercase letters and numbers. Your task is to compare the number groupings and return the largest number. Numbers will not have leading zeros.

For example, solve("gh12cdy695m1") = 695, because this is the largest of all number groupings.

## Question12 : Progressive Spiral Number Position

Assume that you started to store items in progressively expanding square location, like this for the first 9 numbers:

05 04 03
06 01 02
07 08 09
And like this for the expanding to include up to the first 25 numbers:

17 16 15 14 13
18 05 04 03 12
19 06 01 02 11
20 07 08 09 10
21 22 23 24 25
You might easily notice that the first - and innermost - layer containes only one number (01), the second one - immediately around it - contains 8 numbers (number in the 02-09 range) and so on.

Your task is to create a function that given a number n simply returns the number of layers required to store up to n (included).

layers(1) === 1
layers(5) === 2
layers(25) === 3
layers(30) === 4
layers(50) === 5
Fair warning: you will always and only get positive integers, but be ready for bigger numbers in the tests!

## Question13 : Fun with ES6 Classes #2 - Animals and Inheritance

Preloaded for you in this Kata is a class Animal:

class Animal {
constructor(name, age, legs, species, status) {
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
this.legs = legs;
this.species = species;
this.status = status;
}
introduce() {
return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
}
}
Task
Define the following classes that inherit from Animal.

I. Shark
The constructor function for Shark should accept 3 arguments in total in the following order: name, age, status. All sharks should have a leg count of 0 (since they obviously do not have any legs) and should have a species of "shark".

II. Cat
The constructor function for Cat should accept the same 3 arguments as with Shark: name, age, status. Cats should always have a leg count of 4 and a species of "cat".

Furthermore, the introduce/Introduce method for Cat should be identical to the original except there should be exactly 2 spaces and the words "Meow meow!" after the phrase. For example:

var example = new Cat("Example", 10, "Happy");
example.introduce() === "Hello, my name is Example and I am 10 years old. Meow meow!"; // Notice the TWO spaces - very important
III. Dog
The Dog constructor should accept 4 arguments in the specified order: name, age, status, master. master is the name of the dog's master which will be a string. Furthermore, dogs should have 4 legs and a species of "dog".

Dogs have an identical introduce/Introduce method as any other animal, but they have their own method called greetMaster/GreetMaster which accepts no arguments and returns "Hello (insert_master_name_here)" (of course not the literal string but replace the (insert_master_name_here) with the name of the dog's master).

## Question14 : Lost number in number sequence

An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

Example:

The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
Your function should return the int 5.
If no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.

Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).

## Question15 : Fun with ES6 Classes #3 - Cuboids, Cubes and Getters

Define the following classes.

I. Cuboid
The object constructor for the class Cuboid should receive exactly three arguments in the following order: length, width, height and store these three values in this.length, this.width and this.height respectively.

The class Cuboid should then have a getter surfaceArea which returns the surface area of the cuboid and a getter volume which returns the volume of the cuboid.

II. Cube
class Cube is a subclass of class Cuboid. The constructor function of Cube should receive one argument only, its length, and use that value passed in to set this.length, this.width and this.height.

Hint: Make a call to super, passing in the correct arguments, to make life easier ;)

## Question16 : Categorize New Member

The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

Input
Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

Output
Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

Example
input = [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

## Question17 : Sum of odd numbers

Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1
          3     5
       7     9    11

13 15 17 19
21 23 25 27 29
...
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)

1 --> 1
2 --> 3 + 5 = 8
